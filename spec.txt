Personal Post-Install Script

This is a simple script I can run after a fresh installation of Ubuntu. Here's a list of things I generally do after a fresh install. Let's automate as much of that as possible.

Here's the list:
*sudo apt-get update
*sudo apt-get upgrade
*install proprietary graphics drivers
*install docker engine (NOT docker desktop)
*install latest stable release of python
*install discord
*install the 1password firefox add-on
*Solomon's personal scripts:
**(none at this time)
